Golf
====

This is the **YAPC::Russia 2015** Perl golf competition repository. Here you can get tests for your script, examples and description (this _README_).

Input
-----

Your script should accept two integer arguments:

```perl
perl script.pl 10 20
```

This first one is _width_, the second one is _height_.

Output
------

Your script should print to _STDOUT_ the spiral matrix of numbers. The matrix size is set by the input params.

The first number is `1`. The order is clockwise. All columns must be separated by spaces (not tabs) and the gap between columns is exactly one space in the most narrow place. The align is left. Every string should be terminated by `\n`. No extra spaces are allowed.

Solutions will be accepted until _2015-05-17 18:30:00 (GMT+3)_.

How to test
-----------

Place your script in the `solutions` directory.

Run from the root of the repository:

`perl t/spiral.t` – check all solutions

`perl t/spiral.t pushtaev.pl` — check a single solution

`perl bin/result.pl` — show the result table
